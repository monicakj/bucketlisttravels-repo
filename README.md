## Changes

- Created a SCSS folder and moved all the editings from CSS to their own SCSS partials folder.
- Updated the whole About page and made the page responsive as the previous page where not responsive on mobile devices.
- Changed the destination images on the main index page and placed them in a cardgroup to make the layout more clean. I also added a Read More button to each card with the different destinations.
